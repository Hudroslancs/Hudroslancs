I am a self-taught technologist who transitioned into IT, expanding my skills in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and CUDA.

## Objective

My journey began when I was forced to learn networking due to a lack of technical support. That experience sparked a strong interest in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and CUDA, and I am now actively building hands-on skills to transition into this field.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Proxmox VE, KVM, Linux (Ubuntu), Virtualization, Docker  
**Programming:** Python, C++ (learning), Bash, SQL  
**Security:** Penetration Testing, Network Security, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap  
**Web:** Apache, MariaDB, PHP, LAMP Stack  
**Tools:** Git, SSH, Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, Firewall Configuration)
